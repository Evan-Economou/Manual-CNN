# Overview

This project is a full implementation of a convolutional neural network to classify chest x-rays in order to solidify my understanding of the math used in the forward pass and backpropogation of a neural network.

### Dataset
Chest X-Ray Images (Penumonia). Found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia).

Future Work:
GPU parallelization to allow the full data set to be used in training
